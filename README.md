A comprehensive Home Assistant custom integration for Red Energy (Australian energy provider) that provides real-time energy monitoring, advanced analytics, and automation capabilities.

## Fork notice

This repository is a maintained fork of `craibo/ha-red-energy-au`. It preserves the original integration goals while adding authentication tooling, test improvements, and broader Python/Home Assistant compatibility. See Acknowledgments for the original project.

## Recent changes

- Added `.env`-driven auth test at `scripts/auth_test.py` for real-credential verification
- Fixed config flow async behavior by safely awaiting `async_show_form` when mocked
- Resolved test instability and deprecation/runtime warnings in the suite
- Ensured compatibility and test coverage on Python 3.13
- Updated requirements to support Home Assistant core 2025.9.1 and newer

## Quick Start

### Installation via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/craibo/ha-red-energy-au`
6. Select category "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "Red Energy" and click "Download"
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `red_energy` folder from the `custom_components` directory
2. Copy to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for "Red Energy"
3. Enter your Red Energy credentials:
   - **Username**: Your Red Energy account email address
   - **Password**: Your Red Energy account password
   - **Client ID**: Must be captured from Red Energy mobile app using network monitoring tools
4. Select your properties and services (electricity/gas)
5. Configure advanced options if desired

#### Getting Your Client ID

The Client ID is required for OAuth2 authentication with Red Energy's API. To obtain it:

1. Install a network monitoring tool like [Proxyman](https://proxyman.io/) (Mac) or [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)
2. Configure your mobile device to use the proxy
3. Open the Red Energy mobile app and log in
4. Look for API requests to `redenergy.okta.com` or `login.redenergy.com.au`
5. Find the `client_id` parameter in the OAuth2 requests
6. Copy this value to use in the integration setup

⚠️ **Important**: This integration uses the real Red Energy API. You must have valid Red Energy account credentials and a captured client_id to use this integration.

## Sensors Created

### Core Sensors (Always Available)
For each enabled service (electricity/gas) per property:

- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_daily_usage` - Current daily usage (kWh/MJ)
- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_total_cost` - Total cost over data period (AUD)
- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_total_usage` - Total usage over data period (kWh/MJ)

### Advanced Sensors (Optional)
When "Advanced Sensors" are enabled:

- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_daily_average` - Average daily usage
- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_monthly_average` - Projected monthly usage
- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_peak_usage` - Highest single-day usage with date
- `sensor.{property_name}_{service}_efficiency` - Usage consistency efficiency rating (0-100%)

## Service Calls

### Manual Data Refresh
```yaml
service: red_energy.refresh_data
data: {}
```

### Export Usage Data
```yaml
service: red_energy.export_data
data:
  format: json  # or csv
  days: 30      # 1-365 days
```

### Update Credentials
```yaml
service: red_energy.update_credentials
data:
  username: "your@email.com"
  password: "newpassword"
  client_id: "new-client-id"
```

## Energy Dashboard Integration
